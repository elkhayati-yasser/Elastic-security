# Elastic-security
Elastic cluster ( SIEM SOC )


Elastic Security unifies SIEM, endpoint security, and cloud security on an open platform, equipping teams to prevent, detect, and respond to threats.


This repo aims to build a stable and mature (on-prem) elastic cluster , we will start by defining  the Hardware prerequisites (CPU, RAM, Storage ..) ,the architecture ,the components and more ...

# Hardware prerequisites

For a dev enviroments we will need as minimum :

|Memory         | Storage       | CPU   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 16 GB RAM     | 250 GB SSD    |8 CPU Cores|

For a Production enviroments we will need as minimum :

|Memory         | Storage       | CPU   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 32 GB RAM     | 500 GB SSD with minimum 3k dedicated IOPS   |16 CPU cores|

# Architecture

In this project we will adopt the architecture bellow :
