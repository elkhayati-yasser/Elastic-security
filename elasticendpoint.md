# One agent for multiple use cases

With Elastic Agent we can collect all forms of data from anywhere with a single unified agent per host. With elastic agent we can detect, investigate, and respond to evolving threats.


Elastic Security combines SIEM threat detection features with endpoint prevention and response capabilities in one solution. These analytical and protection capabilities, leveraged by the speed and extensibility of Elasticsearch, enable analysts to defend their organization from threats before damage and loss occur.


Elastic Security provides the following security benefits and capabilities:

* A detection engine to identify attacks and system misconfigurations.

* A workspace for event triage and investigations.

* Interactive visualizations to investigate process relationships.

* Inbuilt case management with automated actions.

* Detection of signatureless attacks with prebuilt machine learning anomaly jobs and detection rules.

To benefit of all of this elasticsearch gives us an awsome integration .

Before diving into instalation process let's talk about ***Windows Event Logging*** .

### Windows Event Logging

When activity happens on a Windows computer such as launching an application, opening a file, or logging into a remote computer, the local computer creates logs of those events.

Collecting Windows event logs is a good place to start, but they only document a fraction of what actually happens in a system. To get richer details and to catch everything we need Sysmon.


According to Microsoftâ€™s documentation,

System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. 

By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents **(elastic agent in our case)** and subsequently analyzing them, we can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate on your network.



[Download Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)


We want to use a custom version of the **Sysmon config** file instead of the defaults that come with the app. Most people would be comfortable recommending you start with the version provided by [Swift On Security](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) and adjust it to meet our needs.


Assuming we have downloaded both **sysmon.exe** and **sysmonconfig-export.xml** .


In the administrator's Powershell session, we need to go to the Sysmon folder and install the application.

```
.\sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i PATH\TO\FOLDER\sysmonconfig-export.xml
```

To configure the new Elastic agent on our Windows workstation and ingest the sysmon data into our SIEM, and we should have the fleet server installed and healthy.
